# üß™ IAM Anomaly Simulation Guide

Use this guide to simulate suspicious IAM activity that may trigger GuardDuty findings.

- Create a test user with basic permissions (e.g., read-only access).
- Assign the user to a test group monitored by GuardDuty.
- I ensured test group had basic permissions as well

Simulate Unusual Behavior ny logging in from different countries within short time

- Use a **VPN** to log in from different regions (e.g., Netherlands, USA, Singapore) within a short timeframe.
- GuardDuty may trigger findings like `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/ConsoleLoginSuccess.B`.


From the test user, attempt to:
  - Attach `AdministratorAccess` to their own role.
  - Create a new user or role.
  - Modify IAM policies.

 Monitor GuardDuty
- Navigate to **GuardDuty > Findings**.
- Filter by `resourceType = "IAMUser"` or by `findingType` (e.g., `AnomalousBehavior`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Findings may take a few minutes to appear.

## The function will be triggered resulting in email alert and user being disabled
