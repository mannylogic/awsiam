‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôll need to confirm the subscription via the email sent to you.

## 3. Grant Publish Permissions (if needed)

If your Lambda function isn't in the same account or doesn't have permissions:

- Attach the following inline policy to the Lambda execution role:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "sns:Publish",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:your-region:your-account-id:iam-anomaly-alerts"
}

## -Ensure your Lambda function is subscribed to the SNS topic as well so it runs in response to the cloudwatch event trigger
## -Also Ensure your resources are in the same region, I ran into issues because they weren't
